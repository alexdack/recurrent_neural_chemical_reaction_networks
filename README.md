# recurrent_neural_chemical_reaction_networks

This is the repository for the code and data associated with the paper "Recurrent neural chemical reaction networks that approximate arbitrary dynamics" (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2406.03456). The repository is structured by the examples presented in the paper, but has been designed to be easily modified for application of recurrent neural chemical reaction networks (RNCRNs) to new examples.
